# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution to Autograph.

## Before you start

For anything beyond a small fix, please open an issue first to discuss the change.
This project is in early development and APIs are still moving, so it helps to align
on direction before investing time in a PR.

## Development

- Requires JDK 21 and Kotlin/Compose Multiplatform toolchains (Android SDK, Xcode for
  iOS targets). See the [Requirements](README.md#requirements) section of the README.
- Build and test: `./gradlew build`
- The `autograph-segment-swift` package has its own test suite; see
  [`AutographSegmentSwift/`](AutographSegmentSwift).

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused on a single change. Unrelated cleanup makes review harder.
- Add or update tests for behavior changes.
- Make sure CI passes (`./gradlew build`) before requesting review.
- Follow the existing commit style (`type: short description`, e.g. `fix: ...`,
  `feat: ...`, `chore: ...`).

## Changing public API

Every published module runs `explicitApi()` and `abiValidation()`, so a change to the
public surface shows up as a diff in that module's `api/` dump. Regenerate it with
`./gradlew :<module>:updateKotlinAbi` and verify with `:checkKotlinAbi`.

**An API dump change in a PR is a review checkpoint, not a formality.** Before adding
anything public, read [ADR 0001 — How the public API may evolve after 1.0](docs/adr/0001-public-api-evolution.md).
It classifies each public type by who constructs and who implements it, and the
classification determines what you are allowed to add. In short:

- New configuration goes on `AutographConfig` as a `var`, not into a config `data class`
  constructor (which cannot gain a parameter without breaking ABI).
- New members on an SPI (`Transport`, `SeqStore`, …) must carry a default body that is
  genuinely correct for an implementor who has never heard of the feature. If no such
  default exists, add a separate optional interface instead.
- `Envelope` and `SessionInfo` are constructed by the library only; their constructors are
  intentionally `internal`. Tests construct them through the factory in `autograph-test`.
- Enum constants and sealed subtypes are frozen within a major version.

If a change does not fit those rules, say so in the PR rather than working around them —
the rules exist to make the cost visible, and some changes are worth paying it.

## Reporting bugs

Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/uny/autograph/issues/new) with steps to
reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and relevant environment details (platform,
Kotlin/Compose versions).

For security issues, please follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead of filing a
public issue.
